# Building-a-Modern-Computer
This follows the book: 'The Elements of Computing Systems' - Building a Modern Computer from First Principles
The goal of the course is to build a complete working computer system from simple Nand logic gates. We start by implementing basic logic chips(nand, xor, nor, etc..) with a supplied hardware description language and we finish with a full fledged computer capable of running programs like Tetris

##Scope of Course
1.	Hardware: Logic gates, Boolean arithmetic, multiplexors, flip-flops, registers, RAM units, counters, Hardware Description Language (HDL), chip simulation and testing.
2.	Architecture: ALU/CPU design and implementation, machine code, assembly language programming, addressing modes, memory-mapped input/output (I/O).
3.	Operating Systems: Memory management, math library, basic I/O drivers, screen management, file I/O, high level language support.
4.	Programming Languages: Object-based design and programming, abstract data types, scoping rules, syntax and semantics, references.
5.	Compilers: Lexical analysis, top-down parsing, symbol tables, lists, recursion, arithmetic algorithms, running time considerations.
6.	Data Structures and Algorithms: Stacks, hash tables, lists, recursion, arithmetic algorithms, geometric algorithms, running time considerations.
7.	Software engineering:  Modular design, the interface/implementation paradigm, API design and documentation, proactive testing planning, programming at the large, quality assurance.
